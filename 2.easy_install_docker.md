# Development Mode for Frappe Custom Apps

## Prerequisites : 

```bash
docker
docker-compose
user added to docker group
```

This is simplified using a script to automate the process of creating a new bench / site and installing the required apps. Administrator password is for created sites is admin.

Sample apps-example.json is used by default, it installs erpnext on current stable release. To install custom apps, copy the apps-example.json to custom json file and make changes to list of apps. Pass this file to the installer.py script.

## Clone the Frappe Docker Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/frappe/frappe_docker.git
cd frappe_docker
```

## Setup Development Container

- Copy the Dev Container Config:

    ```bash
    cp -R devcontainer-example .devcontainer
    cp -R development/vscode-example development/.vscode
    ```

- Open in VSCode

    Open the frappe_docker folder in VSCode.

    ```bash
    code .
    ```

- Reopen in Container:

- Use Command Palette (Ctrl + Shift + P) and select Dev Containers: Rebuild and Reopen in Container.

1. Provide write permissions

    ```bash
    sudo chown -R frappe:frappe /workspace/development
    ```
2. Use the installer script

    `Copy the default apps-example.json and customize it`
    ```bash
    cp apps-example.json apps.json
    ```

    Update the list of apps in the apps.json with their git branches you wish to fork

3. Run the installer command:
    ```bash
    python installer.py -b clapgrow_bench -s clapgrow.com -r https://github.com/frappe/frappe.git -t develop -p 3.11.6 -n 18 -a admin -d mariadb -j apps.json
    ```
    
4. Horray! Bench setup and apps installed. Goto <http://127.0.0.1:8000>, login using Administrator as username and admin as the password.

5. After login, in the searchbar (in frappe, we call it `awesome bar` because Frappe is Awesome), search for `CG User` doctype.

6. Create a new record in CG User.  Then Go the User doctype similarly. In the User, go the settings page of the newly created user and then create a password. Logout and Login using that user. Logout.

7. You can access the Frontend page at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/clapgrow` (production server). Login and hooray! We are at the dashboard page!

8. You can also access the local development react server at <http://127.0.0.1:8080>. However, server side changes can only be visible after we do the following in the Bench and check the production server:

    ```bash
    bench update --requirements --patch --build
    ```
